This is a program that one can use to determine the different age groups of a big number of people for example a community.
The current year is set to be 2023
It takes the person's year of birth and subtracts it from 2023.
The result is the person's age.
Scenario One: Now if the person's age is below 18 years, the category will be minor.

Scenario two: if the person's age is between 18 and 36, the person is a youth.

Scenario three: if the person's age is above 36, the person  is an elder.
